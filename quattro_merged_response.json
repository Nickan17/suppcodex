Easy to mix, tastes great and no bad after taste. 12/22/2023 Robert Rowe Amazing product ! Usually I’m very picky about my protein powders, I think we’ve all had some pretty bad ones time and time again. But S/O to magnum supplements this Quattro is AMAZING mix it with some PB and a frozen banana and you have yourself an amazing shake. 11/02/2023 Glen Love it 09/25/2023 Angie Willson My fav protein ever! Tastes great & mixes really well! 09/15/2023 Sarah We prefer the vanilla flavor from the “Shake Series” over this soft serve version. 06/03/2023 Andrew Protein!! Absolutely love this protein. At 30g per scoop, you can’t go wrong. The taste is unmatched. And. The mix ability is so smooth. Highly recommend 06/01/2023 Blake Tried many…Quattro is the ONE! Over the years, I’ve tried A LOT of protein shakes. Some dissolve/mix well and taste bad. Some taste good but mix horribly. Some are really good but not much protein per serving. With the direction of my personal trainer, I was turned on to Quattro Shake Series, Vanilla and Chocolate. MAGNUM NAILED IT!! Both formulas mix extremely well. Taste? Vanilla is delicious. Chocolate: thick, creamy, flavorful AND ACTUALLY SHAKE-LIKE!!!! A product that IS what it SAYS???? That’s what I’ve found with Quattro, as well as the other supplements that I’ve used from them. SOLIDLY NAILED THIS ONE!!!! Load More",
